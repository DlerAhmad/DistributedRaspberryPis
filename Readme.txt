The goal of this project was to design a system that is capable of processing a large computation using a network of machines with limited memory space and processing power. The network was constructed using 10 Raspberry Pis. Our proposed solution made use of distributed algorithms and was able to address fault tolerance and load balancing. We worked on this project in a team of three.
